Embargoed news releases and data files may not be released to the public by any means (including print, broadcast, Internet, podcast, blogs, or in any other form) before the specified date and time of release. Failure to adhere to this embargo policy will result in the removal of embargo privileges of the reporter as follow:

    First breach - six-month suspension of embargo privileges.
    Subsequent breach - one-year suspension of embargo privileges. Reinstatement must be requested in writing.

Wire and distribution services are prohibited from distributing embargoed news releases and data files to subscribers before the public release date and time.

The Census Bureau, through its Public Information Office, reserves the right to deny access to embargoed information to any entity that abuses embargo privileges.

If an embargo is broken, the Census Bureau will immediately release the data to the public and a notification will be sent alerting data users that the information is now available to the public.

The Associate Director for Communications or his/her designee has final approval on all matters pertaining to embargo access.
